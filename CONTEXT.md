# CONTEXT.md — domain terms and invariants

Persisted per the Grilling design-interview protocol (`agent/rules/grill-interview.md`) at the end
of the codegraph-tooling-consolidation mission (2026-09-18). Captures terms/invariants this
mission's decisions (see `docs/adr/ADR-0002-graft-graphify-consolidation.md`) depend on, for future
sessions that touch this repo's code-understanding tooling.

## Terms

- **graft**: `@nanonets/graft`, a tree-sitter-based code-graph tool. Sole code-graph tool in this
  repo as of ADR-0002 (graphify retired). Provides an MCP server (`.mcp.json`) with tools
  `graft_find_code`/`graft_trace_calls`/`graft_find_all`/`graft_file_api`/`graft_repo_map`/
  `graft_check_freshness`, plus a CLI (`graft ask`/`callers`/`skeleton`/etc.). Its graph
  (`graft/`) is git-ignored, per-clone/per-worktree.
- **graphify** (retired by ADR-0002): a community/god-node graph tool via AST+optional LLM
  labeling, git-committed graph, git hooks + merge driver. No longer wired in this repo.
- **executor**: the `executor`/`executor.sh` MCP gateway (`bun add -g executor`). On-demand daemon
  (not a persistent service unless `executor install` is run), ~localhost:4788. Used both directly
  (registered in `.mcp.json`/`pi/mcp.json`) and as a routing layer for graft-on-Pi (integration
  slug `graft-dotfiles`, see `docs/adr/ADR-0001-pi-graft-parity.md`).
- **supermemory**: semantic memory store (`agent/scripts/hooks/supermemory.sh`), wired via
  `session-start.sh` (not `.claude/settings.json` hooks). Partially deployed — systemd units exist
  but were never enabled in this environment; currently inert (no server running).
- **graft's "upkeep" mechanism**: `@nanonets/graft`'s own `runUpkeep()`/`reconcileWiring()`
  (`dist/upkeep.js`, `dist/claude/hooks.js`), called from graft's `session-start` hook handler and
  (per graft's own source comments) from the graft MCP server's own boot path. Silently re-runs
  graft's own `init`, overwriting hand-patched files, whenever a git-ignored version stamp
  (`graft/.cache/wiring-stamp.json`) is missing — a structural certainty in every freshly created
  `git worktree add` checkout. See `.claude/helpers/graft-integrity-check.cjs`'s header comment for
  the full history (first observed 2026-09-13, reproduced again live during this mission's own
  measurement on 2026-09-18).

## Invariants this mission's decisions depend on

- `.claude/helpers/graft-integrity-check.cjs` MUST remain wired on both `SessionStart` and `Stop`
  in `.claude/settings.json` even after removing graft's other hooks (ADR-0002 decision 5) —
  it is the only defense against the upkeep-triggered revert via the MCP-server-boot path, which
  removing the `session-start` hook entry does not close.
- graft's MCP server registration (`.mcp.json`) and CLI remain fully functional after this
  mission — only the *automatic, every-turn* hook wiring is removed. `graft ask`/`callers`/
  `skeleton`/the MCP tools are still the correct way to get code context on demand.
- graphify's removal is full-scope, not just git-mechanism-level: git merge driver +
  post-commit/post-checkout hooks, committed graph artifacts (`.claude/graph/graphify/`), all
  3 harnesses' hint-hook wiring and `validate-harness.sh` checks, documentation (CLAUDE.md,
  `agent/AGENTS*.md`, `agent/README.md`, etc.), the 3 Tier-B orchestration `SKILL.md` files, and
  the Nix package declaration (`nix/modules/home/packages/shared.nix` + its
  `nix/overlays/default.nix` override dependents) — see ADR-0002 decision 7's Tier 1/2/3
  breakdown for the exhaustive file list. There is no code migration needed since nothing else in
  this repo depended on graphify's graph format programmatically. A repo-wide `grep -rIl graphify`
  (2026-09-18, post-cleanup) turns up only deliberately-preserved historical/ADR/CONTEXT.md
  mentions — verify this still holds before reusing this claim in a future session, since new
  references could reappear afterward.
